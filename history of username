The story begins as I toyed with the idea of selling music online. I knew I needed a name, but didn't really have any idea. Things like "Roger's music" or "Vancouver music" are too boring or provincial, but then I wasn't a global company yet either. I also knew I should develop a brand somehow. Classic example: If you see the Nike swoosh, you don't need to see the word _Nike_ to know the brand. But what to do?

I was (and still am actually) going through an astrological phase. In Western astrology, I am an Aquarius, but "Aquarius music" was probably already taken, and if not, it was too boring. In Chinese astrology, I wa born in the year of the tiger and I like tigers, but spelling out Aquarius Tiger or even Aquatiger is too long for the idea of braind (again, think Nike swoosh).

BUT Aquarius has a glyph and after loving the 2 years I spent in Japan I thought: what is the character for tiger and if it was just one character I would use it; it was!

So this is the story behing my username, :aquarius: :U+2Ec1:
